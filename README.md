👋 Hello.. Thanks for checking me out.  Yes, I see you over there...

A few things about me.
- 👀 I’m interested in AWS Cloud, Kubernetes, and cloud-native app development using DevSecOps.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to architect and support multi-tenant Kubernetes environments.
- 💞️ In personal life, I’m looking to collaborate on genealogy research regarding all derivations of the "Iams" surname.
- 📫 How can reach me via LinkedIn. I'm not really a Twitter/Facebook/Instagram guy -- sue me.
